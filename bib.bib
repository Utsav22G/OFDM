Abstract = {"Professor Andreas F. Molisch, renowned researcher and educator, has put together a comprehensive, clear, and authoritative book on wireless communications. The Second Edition , which includes a wealth of new material on important emerging topics, ensures the book will continue to be a key resource for every student, researcher, and practitioner in the field." Professor Moe Win, MIT, USA Wireless communications has grown rapidly over the past decade from a niche market into one of the most important, fast moving industries. Fully updated to incorporate the latest research and developments, Wireless Communications, Second Edition provides an authoritative overview of the principles and applications of mobile communication technology. The author provides an in-depth analysis of current treatment of the area, addressing both the traditional elements, such as Rayleigh fading, BER in flat fading channels, and equalization, and more recently emerging topics like multi-user detection in CDMA},

Abstract = {Abstract: In the last decades, the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse has found a wide range of applications in many areas of science and became a useful tool for physicists dealing, for instance, with optimization problems, with data analysis, with the solution of linear integral equations, etc. The existence of such applications alone should attract the interest of students and researchers in the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse and in related subjects, such as the singular value decomposition theorem for matrices. In this note, we present a tutorial review of the theory of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. We present the first definitions and some motivations, and after obtaining some basic results, we center our discussion on the spectral theorem and present an algorithmically simple expression for the computation of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of a given matrix. We do not claim originality of the results. We rather intend to present a complete and self-contained tutorial review, useful fo},
